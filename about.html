            <h2><Center><b>ABOUT OUR BENGALS BREEDING HOME -  BENGAL CATS FOR SALE</b></Center></h2>     
            <p>Bengal Kittens Breeder is a TICA-registered cattery located in the USA. Our specialties include Bengal Kittens For Sale. My wife and I bought our Bengal Kittens in 2009, and we started breeding them right away. After all these years, we're still interested in the breed. All of our Bengal Kittens and Bengal Cats are grown indoors, and we're here to ensure that the new owners of our Bengal Kittens receive the best possible care. We've worked hard since our beginnings to make the process of buying a Bengal Kitten as simple as possible.<h4>BENGAL KITTEN VACCINATION</h4>
                <p>Bengal Kittens For Sale are cared for as if they were members of the family. They live with us at our house. Every day, all of our kittens interact freely with the rest of the family. They are free to run, jump, and play. We designed a kitten-proof playroom to ensure their safety. As breeders, our goal is to create the healthiest and sweetest kittens possible so that you and your family may experience the cuteness overload that comes with having the sweetest kitten. Our Bengal Kittens For Sale and Bengals Cats For Sale are carefully monitored for any common breed-related illnesses, and all of our kittens are current on all vaccinations and come with a one-year health guarantee. We also offer lifetime assistance to our customers.</p>
                <h4>OUR BENGAL CAT ADOPTION.</h4>
<p>Prepare your home for hypoallergenic cats. Purchase a scratching post, litter box, food and water bowls, and cat bed before bringing your cat home. Make sure the litter box is placed in a quiet, low-traffic area - such as a pantry, guest bathroom or another out-of-the-way corner - where the hypoallergenic cat can defecate in peace. Buy a large Bengal cat carrier, as our Bengal cat for sale can get quite large. It is okay if the carrier seems too large at first; the cat will get used to it. When you bring the hypoallergenic cat home, place the carrier in a room, open the door of the Bengal cat carrier and close the door to the room. Let the cat explore the room at its leisure. Give the Bengal cat room to explore. Our Bengal cats for sale have a high energy level and like to roam. 
    Most prefer to have access to the outdoors. If kept indoors, they should have at least one large apartment to explore. Hypoallergenic apartment cats for sale are at risk for obesity due to their lower activity levels, so watch their food intake carefully. Outdoor cats are at increased risk of injury and illness. Therefore, do not allow them to roam freely in areas where they may come into contact with heavy vehicle traffic, wild animals, or pesticides and other chemicals. Bengal kittens are strong jumpers and like to explore high places. They are nimble cats and don't tend to break things, but you may want to consider keeping valuable or expensive items out of their reach. Provide entertainment. Our Bengal cats for sale are intelligent and need stimulation. Bored Bengal cats can overheat,
     scratch at furniture, and here are some ways to prevent boredom: Buy a ceiling-high "tree" that Bengal kittens for sale can jump up to inspect their territory. Give Bengal kittens cat toys and puzzles. Experiment with yarn, toy mice, laser pointers, and catnip. Many Bengal cats enjoy playing fetch. Encourage it with treats or dry food as rewards. A second Bengal cat often makes the first cat feel less lonely, especially if they are littermates. Make sure the cats are spayed or neutered unless you want to mess with kittens; this is especially important if you have a male and female Bengal kitten together, but outdoor cats may also encounter cats of the opposite sex in your neighborhood How to keep your cat healthy. Bathe the cat occasionally. Bengal cats have a water-resistant, 
     triple-layered coat. Many of them enjoy the water and may try to jump into the bath or shower. Even if your cat doesn't like water, give him a bath whenever his coat gets dirty. Bathing can also reduce allergens if someone in the house is allergic to cats. If necessary, use a mild cat shampoo and conditioner made with oatmeal. Your Bengal cat has a fairly oily coat, which keeps the skin healthy and regulates the cat's temperature. Bathing too often can remove these protective oils. Because of the thick coat, it can take up to 45 minutes for your cat's fur to get completely wet. Check your cat's health weekly. If you have a kitten, start early with these grooming routines so she can get used to them.
     If you have difficulty with these procedures, ask a veterinarian to show you how to do them: Trim the nails once a week or as needed. Use scissors to trim the nails. Check your cat's ears about once a week. If they appear dirty, clean them with a cotton swab moistened with a mild cat ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. If the ears are red or smell bad, take your cat to the veterinarian. Brush your cat's teeth regularly with a veterinarian-recommended toothpaste to ensure good health and fresh breath. Bengal cats can pick up ticks or fleas quite easily. Check outdoor cats regularly and remove ticks and fleas if found. Schedule regular veterinary checkups. Bengal cats are prone to stomach problems, 
     such as irritable bowel syndrome or lymphoma. Visit the veterinarian regularly to keep an eye on their stomach. Bengals are also prone to at least one hereditary health problem: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Bengals to be bred should be screened for HCM, and cats identified with HCM should be removed from breeding programs. Do not purchase kittens whose parents have not been tested for this disease. Feed cats high-quality food. Foods can cause higher or lower levels of allergens. High-quality food can also prevent many health problems in cats. Feed only the amounts recommended by your veterinarian, keeping treat consumption in mind. Keeping a Bengal cat at the proper weight is one of the easiest ways to protect its overall health. If your cat is overweight, dieting may be necessary.</p>
     <h4>PET INSURANCE FOR OUR BENGAL KITTENS FOR SALE.</h4>
     <p>Insurance for purebred Bengal cats costs more than insurance for mixed breed Bengal cats. This is because a purebred Bengal cat is more likely than a mixed breed Bengal cat to file claims for hereditary diseases, which are expensive to treat. We include pet insurance plans for our Bengal cats for sale and provide full coverage for all Bengal kittens for the adoption-specific conditions (except those already present) to which purebred Bengal cats are prone. The best time to purchase insurance for your Bengal cat is when it is a healthy Bengal kitten. You can't predict what will happen in the future, and pet insurance is the one thing you can't have when you need it most. Bengal kitten health insurance is administered by Embrace Pet Insurance Agency, LLC and underwritten by one of the licensed insurers of American Modern Insurance Group, Inc. 
        including American Modern Home Insurance Company d/b/a in NC as American Modern Insurance Company (Lic. No 2222-8), and American Southern Home Insurance Company. Coverage is subject to terms, conditions, limitations, exclusions, underwriter review, and approval and may not be available for all risks or in all states. Rates and discounts vary, are determined by many factors, and are subject to change. Wellness Rewards is offered as an uninsured supplemental benefit administered by Embrace Pet Insurance Agency in the United States. 2020 American Modern Insurance Group, Inc + Wellness Rewards is not available in all states</p>
