            <h2><center><b>ABOUT THE BENGAL CAT BREED</b></center></h2>
            <h3><left><b>HISTORY OF THE BENGAL CAT BREED</left></b></h3>    
            <p>Bengal cats are a hybrid breed. Breeders combined domestic cats with Asian leopard cats, a tiny, wild species that is indigenous to Southeast Asia, in the early 1900s. Asian leopard cats, also known as Felis bengalensis, which is where the name "Bengal" is from. Bengal cats are renowned for their wild appearance and slender form. Even though breed fusions started more than 120 years ago, 
                it wasn't until Jean Sugden Mill crossed domestic cat breeds with Asian leopard cats that the Bengal species was actually established. She wanted to create a breed that combined a domestic house cat's temperament with the unique appearance of the Asian leopard cat. Today's Bengal kittens are descended from other Bengals and are several generations removed from their exotic origins. They are currently among the priciest cat breeds, with a show-quality Bengal costing up to $2,000 on average
                <a href="https://tica.org/">International Cat Association</a> was the first cat organization to officially acknowledge the Bengal breed, giving it experimental status in 1983 and full recognition in 1991. The United Feline Organization, the Canadian Cat Association, and the American Cat Fanciers Association all recognize the Bengal.
