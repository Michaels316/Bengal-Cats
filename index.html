    <h2>ABOUT BENGAL CAT BREED</h2>
    <p>Bengal Cats For Sale, Silver Bengals For Sale, Brown Bengal For Sale, Black Bengal For Sale, Snow Bengal For Sale</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>BENGAL CAT HISTORY</h3>
                <p>Bengal cats are a hybrid breed. Breeders combined domestic cats with Asian leopard cats, a tiny, wild species that is indigenous to Southeast Asia, in the early 1900s. Asian leopard cats, also known as Felis bengalensis, which is where the name "Bengal" is from. Bengal cats are renowned for their wild appearance and slender form. Even though breed fusions started more than 120 years ago, 
                it wasn't until Jean Sugden Mill crossed domestic cat breeds with Asian leopard cats that the Bengal species was actually established. She wanted to create a breed that combined a domestic house cat's temperament with the unique appearance of the Asian leopard cat. Today's Bengal kittens are descended from other Bengals and are several generations removed from their exotic origins. They are currently among the priciest cat breeds, with a show-quality Bengal costing up to $2,000 on average
                <a href="https://tica.org/">International Cat Association</a> was the first cat organization to officially acknowledge the Bengal breed, giving it experimental status in 1983 and full recognition in 1991. The United Feline Organization, the Canadian Cat Association, and the American Cat Fanciers Association all recognize the Bengal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>BENGAL CAT PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p>The Bengal cat is a very intelligent and active animal. He might be difficult at times, but this makes him enjoyable to live with. Overall, the Bengal cat for sale is a self-assured, chatty, sociable, and watchful cat. He notices everything. He enjoys playing games, like fetch, and is a pro at picking up new skills. It's a good thing he doesn't have opposable thumbs because his dexterous paws are almost as excellent as his hands because he would probably dominate the world. Bengal cats who are bored may also develop some unusual (and occasionally destructive) behaviors, including turning on and off light switches, snagging seals in drains, and gleefully removing CDs from your DVD player
                The Bengal cat for sale enjoys playing in the water and won't hesitate to accompany you into the shower or tub. He may endanger pond and aquarium fish with his cunning paws. He also enjoys climbing and is frequently seen perched on the highest shelf in the house. For this cat, puzzle toys that will test his wits and at least one tall cat tree are necessities.
The friendly Bengal will be happy to sit on your lap on the infrequent occasions when he isn't swinging from chandeliers or swimming in your pool. He will obviously sleep in your bed with you. He does indeed steal the covers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>BENGAL CAT CARE</h3>
            <p>The Bengal's short, dense coat requires only weekly brushing to remove dead hair and disperse skin oils. Rarely is a bath required.
To avoid periodontal disease, brush your Bengal kitten’s teeth. Although daily brushing is preferred, once a week is still preferable to never. Twice a month, trim your Bengal cat’s nails. To get rid of any discharge, use a soft, damp cloth to wipe the corners of your Bengals eyes. To prevent the transmission of any illness, use a different section of the towel for each eye. Each week, check your Bengal cat’s ears. If they appear to be unclean, clean them with a cotton ball or soft, damp cloth dipped in a 50/50 solution of warm water and cider vinegar. Do not use cotton swabs as they can harm surfaces.
Maintain a tidy litter box. Cats are extremely picky when it comes to bathroom hygiene, so a filthy litter box can make them start using other areas of the house instead.
A Bengal Cat For Sale should only be kept indoors to prevent him from contracting illnesses from other cats, being attacked by dogs or coyotes, and other risks that face cats who venture outside, like getting hit by a car. Keeping your Bengal cat indoors also safeguards neighborhood wildlife and birds from this hunter.</p>
